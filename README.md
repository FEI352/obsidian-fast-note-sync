## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Minimalist Configuration**:
    - No tedious setup required, just paste the remote service configuration to start using it out of the box.
    - Can also use one-click import on the desktop app to automatically complete authorization.
- 📗 **Real-time Note Sync**:
    - Automatically monitors and syncs the creation, update, and deletion of all notes inside the Vault (repository).
- 🖼️ **Full Attachment Support**:
    - Syncs images, videos, audio, and all other non-configuration files in real-time.
    > ⚠️ **Note**: Requires v1.0+, Server v0.9+. Please manage attachment file sizes; large files may cause synchronization delays.
- ⚙️ **Configuration Sync**:
    - Provides configuration sync, supporting config synchronization across multiple devices. Say goodbye to the pain of manually copying configuration files to multiple devices.
    > ⚠️ **Note**: Requires v1.4+, Server v1.0+. Currently in the testing phase, please use with caution.
- 🛂 **Sync Exclusions & Whitelist**:
    - Provides sync exclusion and whitelist functions, allowing you to customize your own sync strategies.
- 🔄 **Multi-device Sync**:
    - Supports Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and other platforms.
- 📝 **Note History**:
    - Provides note history functionality, letting you view detailed historical modification records of your notes.
    - You can restore notes to historical versions.
- 🛡️ **Offline Note Editing Auto-Merge**:
    - Automatically merges note modifications made on offline devices when reconnecting to the server, avoiding data loss caused by keeping only the latest update.
- 🚫 **Offline Deletion Sync & Completion**:
    - Deletions of notes, attachments, and configurations during offline periods will be automatically synced to the server or completed from the server upon the next connection.
- 🔍 **Version Detection**:
    - Provides version detection functionality, allowing you to quickly get the latest version info of the plugin and the server for easy upgrading.
- ☁️ **Cloud Preview of Attachments**:
    - Provides online attachment preview, meaning attachments do not need to be synced to the local device, thereby saving local storage space.
    > Combined with the plugin's exclusion settings, you can directly use a third-party repository (like WebDav) for certain types of attachments without uploading via the server.
- 🗒️ **Sync Logs**:
    - Provides sync log functionality, making it easy to view detailed information for each synchronization.
- **Cloud Backup**: Provides cloud backup functionality to protect your note data from being lost.

### Recovery of remotely deleted files

Server-requested deletions move notes, attachments, empty folders, and configuration files to the vault's local `.trash` directory. Existing targets displaced by a remote rename also go to local trash. This applies regardless of Obsidian's system-trash preference. If moving an item to trash fails, the operation reports an error and does not fall back to permanent deletion.

The `.trash` directory is excluded from synchronization, including whitelist rules. Recovery copies remain local to that device; restore them manually with your file manager. This does not change temporary-chunk cleanup or the optional cloud-preview feature that removes local attachments after upload.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are continuously improving, and the following are future development plans:
- [ ] **End-to-End Encryption**: Provide end-to-end encryption to ensure your note data is safe wherever it is stored.
- [ ] **AI Notes**: Explore innovative ways to use AI with notes, awaiting your valuable suggestions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Step 1: Get the Plugin**

* **Store Search:** Open Obsidian **Settings** > **Community Plugins** > **Browse**, search for `Fast Note Sync` to install. *(Note: If not listed in the store, please choose manual installation)*
* **Manual Download:** Download `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/haierkeys/obsidian-fast-note-sync/releases) and place them in the `.obsidian/plugins/fast-note-sync` folder.

**Step 2: Authorize Sync**

1. Access the Web interface of your deployed **[Fast Note Sync Service](https://github.com/liu-zhengdong/fast-note-sync-service)**.
2. Select **"Note Vaults"** from the left navigation bar.
3. Click **"One-click Authorization for Obsidian"**. The system will automatically wake up Obsidian and complete the transfer of authorization information. Of course, you can also manually copy the authorization information into the plugin.
